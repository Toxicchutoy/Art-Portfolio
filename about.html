            <p class="about-text"> I am an artist who has a love for traditional drawing and digital art. I started my art journey
                by doing little simple drawings in my notebook like shapes and stick figures and I eventually got to drawing things
                like people and cartoon characters. Drawing was a struggle for me in the beginning which made me not really like it
                at first but I kept up with it and soon got started to make a little progress and get better at drawing. The more I
                got into art the more I wanted to try different artistic approaches. I then started to explore digital art and found
                Photoshop and other Adobe products. With no experience, I began teaching myself how to use these apps by watching
                videos and trying to learn from them.</p>
